Introduction
=======================


* Probability is the study of random events.
* Statistics is the discipline of using data samples to support claims about populations.
* Computation is a tool that is well suited to quantitative analysis. 


Anecdotal evidence
-----------------------------

* Evidence based on unpublished data and usually personal (opinion).

* Small number of observations

* Selection bias

  people who join a discussion might be more inclined towards a specific conclusion
  
* Confirmation bias

  People who believe the claim might be more likely to contribute examples that confirm it.
  People who doubt the claim are more likely to cite counter examples.
  
* Inaccuracy

  Personal stories, often misremembered, misrepresented, repeated inaccurately.

    
Statistical approach
-----------------------------------

* Data collection
* Descriptive statistics
* Exploratory data analysis
* Hypothesis testing
* Estimation


:index:`Population <pair:population;statistics>`

    A group we are interested in studying [a group of people, animals, minerals etc.]
    
:index:`Cross sectional study <pair:cross sectional study;statistics>`

    A study that collects data about a population at a particular point in time
    
    
:index:`Longitudinal study <pair:longitudinal study;statistics>`

    A study that follows a population over time, collecting data from the same group
    repeatedly.
    
:index:`Respondent <pair:respondent;statistics>`

    A person who responds to a survey.
    
:index:`Cohort <pair:cohort;statistics>`

    A group of respondents.
    
:index:`Sample <pair:sample;statistics>`

    The subset of population used to collect data.
    
:index:`Representative <pair:representative;statistics>`

    A sample is representative if every member of the population has the same chance 
    of being in the sample.
    
    
:index:`Oversampling <pair:oversampling;statistics>`

    The technique of increasing the representation of a sub-population in order
    to avoid errors due to small sample sizes.
    
Record

    A collection of information about a single person or other object of study.
    
Field

    One of the named variables that makes up a record.
    
Table 

    A collection of records.
    
:index:`Raw data <pair:raw data;statistics>`

    Values collected and recorded with little or no checking, calculation or interpretation.
    
:index:`Recode <pair:recode;statistics>`

    A value that is generated by calculation and other logic applied to raw data.
    
:index:`Summary statistic <pair:summary statistic;statistics>`

    The result of a computation that reduces a dataset to a single number (or 
    a small set of numbers) that captures some characterisitc of the data.
    
:index:`Apparent effect <pair:apparent effect;statistics>`

    A measurement or summary statistic that suggests that something interesting is happening.
    
    
:index:`Statistically significant <pair:statistically significant;statistics>`

    Any apparent effect is statistically significant if it is unlikely to occur by chance.
    

:index:`Artifact <pair:artifact;statistics>`

    An apparent effect that is caused by bias, measurement error, or some other kind of error.
