Explorations
=======================

This section covers some ideas which I need to pursue further

.. rubric:: HK p. 34, Sec. 2.1 Ex. 4

Let :math:`V` be the set of all pairs :math:`(x,y)` of real numbers, and 
let :math:`F` be the field of real numbers. Define

.. math::

    (x,y) + (x_1, y_1) = (x + x_1, y + y_1)
    
    c(x,y) = (cx,y)
    

* Verify that this is a vector space.

* Whats the use of this system in engineering?
