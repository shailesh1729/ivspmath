Defining a vector space
---------------------------------

* Choose the field F over which vector space will be defined.
* Choose the set of objects V which will become vector space.
* Define the addition operation s.t.

  * Set is closed under addition
  * Commutativity holds
  * Associativity holds
  * Additive identity exists
  * Additive inverse exists
  
* Define the scalar multiplication (from a constant :math:`c \in F`) s.t.
 
  * Scalar multiplication with 1 leads to no change
  * Distributive laws hold
  * Associative law holds over two multiplicands :math:`c_1, c_2`
  
* Be Happy!
